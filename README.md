## FAQ

**Where did you gather the sources for the holidays?**
The holiday dates are sourced from the official spreadsheet for legal holidays for 2024, provided by the head of HR.

**I think you may have missed a holiday?:**
The Weekend marker takes priority over the Holiday marker. It is likely that your holiday falls on a weekend for the current year. Unfortunately, this means it will not be marked separately as a holiday.
